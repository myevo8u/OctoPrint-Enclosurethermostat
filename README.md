# OctoPrint-Enclosurethermostat

This plugin was custom written to assist in controlling my arduino controlled Cooling/Heating system for my 3d printer enclosure VIA serial connection. This plugin can deffinitley be repurposed to control other serial connected devices. Once I feel like this is in good working order, I will also release the Arduino code as well which controls the 120v heater and 12v fan for cooling.

I am still working on some sections of the code (E.g the graph used with plotpy)
